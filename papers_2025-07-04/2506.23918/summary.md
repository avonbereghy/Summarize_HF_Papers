## Summary

## Executive Summary
The paper **Thinking with Images for Multimodal Reasoning** introduces a new paradigm in artificial intelligence, where models can **think with images** rather than just processing them as static inputs. This shift is characterized by the use of visual information as intermediate steps in the thought process, transforming vision into a dynamic *cognitive workspace*. The authors outline a three-stage framework for this evolution, from **external tool exploration** to **programmatic manipulation** and finally to **intrinsic imagination**. By leveraging *multimodal reasoning* and *Chain-of-Thought* (CoT) methods, this new paradigm has the potential to create more powerful and *human-aligned* multimodal AI systems.
