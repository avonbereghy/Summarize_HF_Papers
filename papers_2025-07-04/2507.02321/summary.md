## Summary

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces **InnerControl**, a novel training strategy that enhances the performance of text-to-image diffusion models by enforcing spatial consistency across all diffusion steps. By utilizing *lightweight convolutional probes* to reconstruct input control signals from intermediate *UNet features*, the method enables pseudo ground truth controls for training. This approach improves both **control fidelity** and *generation quality*, achieving state-of-the-art performance when combined with established techniques like **ControlNet++**. The key concept of **alignment loss** is used to minimize the discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire *diffusion process*.
