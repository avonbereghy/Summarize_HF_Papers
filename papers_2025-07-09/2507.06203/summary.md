**Paper ID:** 2507.06203

**URL:** https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.06203

## Summary

## Executive Summary
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of **latent reasoning** in Large Language Models (LLMs), which enables *multi-step inference* entirely in the model's continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. The authors examine the foundational role of **neural network layers** as the computational substrate for reasoning, highlighting how *hierarchical representations* support complex transformations. By exploring diverse **latent reasoning methodologies**, including *activation-based recurrence* and *hidden state propagation*, the survey aims to clarify the conceptual landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the frontier of LLM cognition.

## Key Contributions and Findings
