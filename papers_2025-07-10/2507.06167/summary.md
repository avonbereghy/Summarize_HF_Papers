## Summary

## Executive Summary
The Skywork-R1V3 technical report introduces an advanced, open-source **vision-language model** (VLM) that pioneers a new approach to *visual reasoning*. The key innovation lies in effectively transferring *reasoning skills* from **text-only Large Language Models** (LLMs) to *visual tasks*. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 stems from an elaborate **post-training RL framework**, which enhances the model's *reasoning ability* without the need for additional *pre-training*. This approach enables the model to achieve **state-of-the-art results** on multimodal reasoning tasks, rivaling top closed-source VLMs and matching *entry-level human capabilities*.
