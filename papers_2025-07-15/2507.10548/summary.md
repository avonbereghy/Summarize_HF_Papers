## Summary

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces **EmbRACE-3K**, a dataset designed to evaluate the **embodied reasoning** capabilities of *vision-language models* (VLMs) in complex, interactive environments. The dataset consists of over 3,000 language-guided tasks that require *spatial reasoning*, *long-horizon planning*, and *multi-stage goal execution*. The authors establish a benchmark to assess VLMs across three key dimensions: **Exploration**, **Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning**, and **Multi-stage Goal Execution**, highlighting the *current limitations* of VLMs in interactive environments. By fine-tuning a VLM using **supervised learning** and *reinforcement learning*, the authors demonstrate the utility of EmbRACE-3K in enabling the development of *embodied reasoning capabilities*.

## Results and Performance
The key results show that VLMs achieve **success rates** below 20% in *zero-shot settings*, highlighting the *challenges* posed by interactive environments. The fine-tuned model achieves *substantial improvements* across all three challenge categories, with **performance gains** in **Exploration**, **Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning**, and **Multi-stage Goal Execution**. The results are compared to *state-of-the-art models*, such as *GPT-4o*, *Claude 3.5 Sonnet*, and *Gemini 2.5 Pro*, which exhibit *clear limitations* in *spatial reasoning* and *long-horizon planning*.

## Limitations and Future Work
The limitations of the study include the *current limitations* of VLMs in interactive environments and the need for *further research* in embodied reasoning and *multimodal learning*. Potential future directions include the development of *new models* and *algorithms* that can effectively address the challenges posed by interactive environments.
