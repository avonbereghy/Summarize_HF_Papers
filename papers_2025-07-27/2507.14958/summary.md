**Paper ID:** 2507.14958

**URL:** https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.14958

## Summary

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces **Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR)**, a novel approach to optimize the reasoning efficiency of *Large Language Models (LLMs)*. By dynamically allocating thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps, MUR reduces computation by over *50%* on average while improving accuracy. This is achieved through the concept of **momentum** in physics, which inspires the tracking and aggregation of *stepwise uncertainty* over time. The proposed **gamma-control** mechanism allows for flexible inference-time control via a single hyperparameter, making MUR a promising solution for *reasoning-intensive tasks*.

## Key Contributions and Findings
* **Improved Reasoning Efficiency**: MUR reduces computation by over *50%* on average while improving accuracy by *0.62-3.37%*, demonstrating its potential to optimize LLMs for *reasoning-intensive tasks*.
* **Theoretical Foundations**: The paper provides *in-depth theoretical proof* to support the superiority of MUR in terms of *stability* and *biases*, establishing a solid foundation for the proposed approach.
* **Flexible Inference-Time Control**: The introduction of **gamma-control** enables flexible control over the reasoning budget via a single hyperparameter, allowing for *easy adaptation* to different tasks and models.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation**: MUR is evaluated against various *Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods* across four challenging benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in *real-world scenarios*.

## Methodology Overview
The methodology involves **Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR)**, which consists of two major components: **tracking and aggregating stepwise uncertainty** over time, and **dynamically allocating thinking budgets** to critical reasoning steps. The approach utilizes *specific techniques* such as **gamma-control** to tune the reasoning budget via a single hyperparameter, allowing for *flexible inference-time control*.

## Results and Performance
The results demonstrate that MUR achieves **improved accuracy** by *0.62-3.37%* while reducing **computation** by over *50%* on average. The evaluation is performed across four challenging benchmarks, including *MATH-500*, *AIME24*, *AIME25*, and *GPQA-diamond*, using different sizes of recent *Qwen3 models* (1.7B, 4B, and 8B). The comparison with various *TTS methods* highlights the effectiveness of MUR in *real-world scenarios*.

## Limitations and Future Work
The paper does not explicitly mention any limitations, but potential future directions may include:
* Exploring the application of MUR to other *natural language processing tasks*
* Investigating the use of *different uncertainty estimation methods*
* Evaluating MUR on a wider range of *benchmarks and models*

## Practical Applications
The proposed MUR approach has potential real-world applications in *natural language processing*, such as:
* **Improving language model efficiency** for *reasoning-intensive tasks*
* **Enhancing question-answering systems** with more accurate and efficient reasoning
* **Optimizing language models for edge devices** with limited computational resources, enabling more *efficient* and *effective* language understanding and generation.
