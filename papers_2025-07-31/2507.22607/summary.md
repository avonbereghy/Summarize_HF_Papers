## Summary

## Executive Summary
The proposed **VL-Cogito** model utilizes a novel **Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (PCuRL)** framework to enhance *multimodal reasoning* capabilities in large language models. By introducing an *online difficulty soft weighting mechanism* and a *dynamic length reward mechanism*, the model is guided through tasks of gradually increasing difficulty, resulting in substantially improved *reasoning abilities* across diverse *multimodal contexts*. This approach enables **VL-Cogito** to consistently match or surpass existing *reasoning-oriented models* in mainstream *multimodal benchmarks*, demonstrating the effectiveness of the **PCuRL** framework in addressing the limitations of current models.
