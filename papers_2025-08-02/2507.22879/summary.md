# RecGPT Technical Report

**Paper ID:** 2507.22879

**URL:** https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.22879

## Summary

## Executive Summary
The **RecGPT** technical report proposes a *next-generation* framework for recommender systems, shifting the focus from **log-fitting** objectives to **intent-centric** design. By integrating *large language models* (**LLMs**) into key stages of the recommendation pipeline, RecGPT aims to capture users' *evolving and latent interests*, ultimately fostering a more *sustainable and mutually beneficial* recommendation ecosystem. The report highlights the potential of **LLM-driven** design to improve user experience, increase content diversity, and boost conversions for merchants and the platform.

## Key Contributions and Findings
* **Rethinking Recommender Systems**: The authors propose a new design paradigm that places *user intent* at the center of the recommendation pipeline, addressing the limitations of traditional **log-fitting** approaches.
* **Intent-Centric Framework**: RecGPT integrates **LLMs** into key stages of user interest mining, item retrieval, and explanation generation, enabling a more *accurate and diverse* recommendation process.
* **Multi-Stage Training Paradigm**: The authors introduce a *reasoning-enhanced pre-alignment* and *self-training evolution* approach, guided by a **Human-LLM cooperative judge system**, to effectively align **LLMs** with domain-specific recommendation tasks.
* **Real-World Deployment**: RecGPT has been fully deployed on the *Taobao App*, demonstrating its potential for *large-scale* and *real-world* applications.
* **Comprehensive Performance Gains**: The framework achieves consistent performance gains across stakeholders, including *increased content diversity and satisfaction* for users, and *greater exposure and conversions* for merchants and the platform.

## Methodology Overview
The RecGPT framework consists of **three major components**: user interest mining, item retrieval, and explanation generation. The authors employ *large language models* (**LLMs**) and a **multi-stage training paradigm**, which includes *reasoning-enhanced pre-alignment* and *self-training evolution*, to align **LLMs** with domain-specific recommendation tasks. The framework is guided by a **Human-LLM cooperative judge system**, ensuring that the recommendations are *accurate and relevant*.

## Results and Performance
The online experiments demonstrate that RecGPT achieves **consistent performance gains** across stakeholders, with *increased content diversity and satisfaction* for users, and **greater exposure and conversions** for merchants and the platform. The results show **significant improvements** in *user engagement* and *merchant sales*, with *increased click-through rates* and *conversion rates*. The framework also achieves **better performance** compared to traditional *log-fitting* approaches, with *more accurate and diverse* recommendations.

## Limitations and Future Work
The authors mention that the **RecGPT** framework is not without limitations, including the need for *large-scale training data* and *computational resources*. Potential future directions include *improving the efficiency* of the framework, *exploring new applications* of **LLMs** in recommender systems, and *investigating the potential* of **RecGPT** in other domains.

## Practical Applications
The **RecGPT** framework has significant implications for *real-world applications* in e-commerce, social media, and content recommendation. The framework can be used to improve *user experience*, increase *content diversity*, and boost *conversions* for merchants and the platform. Potential applications include *personalized product recommendations*, *content discovery*, and *social media feed ranking*. The framework can also be used to address *cold start problems* and *long-tail phenomena* in recommender systems, ultimately fostering a more *sustainable and mutually beneficial* recommendation ecosystem.
