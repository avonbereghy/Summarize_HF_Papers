**URL:** https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.23726

## Summary

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces **Seed-Prover**, a novel approach to automated theorem proving that leverages *reinforcement learning* and *formal verification* to achieve significant advancements in mathematical reasoning. By utilizing a dedicated domain-specific language like **Lean**, Seed-Prover can refine its proof iteratively based on *feedback* and *self-summarization*. This enables both **deep** and **broad reasoning** capabilities, making it an effective tool for solving complex mathematical problems, including *IMO-level contest problems*.

## Key Contributions and Findings
* **Automated Theorem Proving**: Seed-Prover achieves a high success rate in proving formalized past IMO problems, with *78.1%* of problems solved, demonstrating its effectiveness in automated mathematical reasoning.
* **Geometry Reasoning Engine**: The introduction of **Seed-Geometry** addresses the lack of geometry support in Lean, outperforming previous formal geometry engines and providing a comprehensive solution for geometric problems.
* **Test-Time Inference Strategies**: The design of three test-time inference strategies enables Seed-Prover to perform both *deep* and *broad reasoning*, allowing it to tackle complex problems from multiple angles.
* **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Seed-Prover outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin, achieving over *50%* on PutnamBench and saturating MiniF2F.
* **Real-World Applications**: The use of Seed-Prover and Seed-Geometry in participating in IMO 2025 and fully proving *5 out of 6 problems* demonstrates the potential of these systems in real-world applications.

## Methodology Overview
The methodology involves **Seed-Prover**, a *lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model* that can iteratively refine its proof based on **Lean feedback**, *proved lemmas*, and *self-summarization*. The approach also includes the use of **Seed-Geometry**, a geometry reasoning engine that provides support for geometric problems. The system utilizes *reinforcement learning* and *formal verification* to achieve effective training and high success rates.

## Results and Performance
The key results include **78.1%** of formalized past IMO problems solved, **over 50%** on PutnamBench, and **saturation** of MiniF2F. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Seed-Prover in automated mathematical reasoning, with *significant improvements* over the previous state-of-the-art. The performance of Seed-Prover is also compared to other systems, showing its *superiority* in solving complex mathematical problems.

## Limitations and Future Work
The paper does not explicitly mention limitations, but potential future directions include:
* Expanding the capabilities of Seed-Prover to tackle more complex mathematical problems
* Improving the performance of Seed-Geometry in geometric reasoning
* Exploring the application of Seed-Prover and Seed-Geometry in other domains, such as *computer science* and *engineering*

## Practical Applications
The potential real-world applications of Seed-Prover and Seed-Geometry include:
* **Automated proof verification**: Seed-Prover can be used to verify the correctness of mathematical proofs, reducing the time and effort required for human verification.
* **Mathematical discovery**: The system can be used to d√©couvrir new mathematical concepts and theorems, accelerating the pace of mathematical research.
* **Education**: Seed-Prover and Seed-Geometry can be used as tools for teaching mathematics, providing students with a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and helping them develop problem-solving skills.
