  "abstract": "Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of\nweb agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin\nto human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire\nsufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,\nwe decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge\ncontent learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose\nWeb-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and\nProcedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the\nagent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two\nknowledge types, representing the \"what\" of learning. Conversely, cognitive\nprocesses correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining\nthe \"how\" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we\nconstruct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world\nwebsites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web\nagent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the \"nouns\" upon\nwhich comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason\nand act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through\na novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing\nand training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation\nreveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in\ngeneralizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable\nrigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation\nsuite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated\nknowledge domains and cognitive capabilities.
