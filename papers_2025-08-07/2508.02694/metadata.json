  "abstract": "The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have\nenabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their\nescalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the\nfirst systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern\nagent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without\nsacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much\ncomplexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules\nyield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the\ndesign of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA\nbenchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework\ndesigns, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we\nquantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our\nfindings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework\nthat has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains\n96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while\nreducing operational costs from 0.398 to 0.228, resulting in a 28.4%\nimprovement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for\ndesigning efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility\nand sustainability of AI-driven solutions.",
