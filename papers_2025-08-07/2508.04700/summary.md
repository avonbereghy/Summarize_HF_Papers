## Summary

## Executive Summary

This paper introduces **SEAgent**, a novel *self-evolving* framework for computer use agents (CUAs) that enables autonomous learning from experience. Unlike existing methods relying heavily on *human-labeled data*, SEAgent allows CUAs to master *novel software environments* through *iterative trial-and-error*.  It achieves this by employing a *World State Model* for trajectory assessment, a *Curriculum Generator* for task progression, and a policy update mechanism combining *adversarial imitation of failures* and *Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)*.  A *specialist-to-generalist* training strategy further enhances the agent's adaptability, resulting in superior performance compared to existing CUAs, such as UI-TARS, achieving a *23.2% improvement in success rate* across five diverse software environments.


## Key Contributions and Findings

* **Autonomous Learning from Experience:** SEAgent enables CUAs to learn and adapt to *unfamiliar software* without relying on extensive human annotation, significantly reducing the need for manual labeling.  *This is achieved through a curriculum learning approach and reinforcement learning techniques.*

* **Self-Evolving Framework:** The *specialist-to-generalist* training strategy allows SEAgent to continuously improve its capabilities by integrating knowledge gained from interactions with various software environments, leading to a more robust and adaptable generalist agent. *This surpasses the performance of ensembles of specialist agents.*

* **Novel Curriculum Generation and Policy Optimization:** The *Curriculum Generator* dynamically creates increasingly complex tasks, while the policy update mechanism combines *adversarial imitation learning* and *GRPO* to efficiently learn from both successes and failures. *This ensures effective and efficient learning.*

* **Improved Performance on Novel Software:** SEAgent demonstrates a *significant 23.2% improvement in success rate (from 11.3% to 34.5%)* compared to the open-source CUA, UI-TARS, across five diverse software environments within OS-World. *This validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.*

* **World State Model for Trajectory Assessment:** The *World State Model* provides a structured way to evaluate the agent's actions and progress, enabling more effective learning and adaptation.  *This is crucial for the curriculum learning and policy optimization components.*


## Methodology Overview

SEAgent employs a *self-evolving* approach where a CUA interacts with *novel software environments*.  A **World State Model** assesses the agent's actions and progress. A **Curriculum Generator** creates a sequence of tasks increasing in complexity. The agent's policy is updated using *adversarial imitation learning* for failures and *Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)* for successes.  Finally, a **specialist-to-generalist training strategy** integrates knowledge from multiple specialized agents to create a more robust generalist CUA.


## Results and Performance

SEAgent achieved a *23.2% increase in success rate*, improving from *11.3% to 34.5%* compared to the baseline CUA, UI-TARS, across five different software environments within OS-World. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the *self-evolving* and *specialist-to-generalist* training strategies.


## Limitations and Future Work

While SEAgent shows promising results, limitations include the *reliance on a specific software environment (OS-World)* and the potential for *overfitting to the specific tasks generated by the Curriculum Generator*. Future work could explore *transfer learning* to other software environments and *more sophisticated curriculum generation techniques* to enhance generalization.


## Practical Applications

SEAgent's ability to autonomously learn and adapt to new software has significant implications for various applications, including:

* **Automated software testing:**  SEAgent could be used to automatically test software for bugs and usability issues.
* **Robotic process automation (RPA):** SEAgent could automate complex tasks involving multiple software applications.
* **Personalized software assistance:** SEAgent could provide customized assistance to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
* **Development of AI agents for complex tasks:** SEAgent's approach could be applied to other domains requiring autonomous learning and adaptation.
