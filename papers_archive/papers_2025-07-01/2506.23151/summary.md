The key results show that **MEMFOF** achieves **state-of-the-art performance** across multiple benchmarks, with *notable metrics* including:
* **1-pixel (1px) outlier rate** of *3.289* on the Spring benchmark
* **Endpoint Error (EPE)** of *0.963* on Sintel (clean)
* **Fl-all error** of *2.94%* on KITTI-2015
These results demonstrate that **MEMFOF** outperforms more *resource-intensive alternatives* in both *accuracy* and *runtime efficiency*.

## Limitations and Future Work
The paper does not explicitly mention any limitations, but potential future directions could include:
