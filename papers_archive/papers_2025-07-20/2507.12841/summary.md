## Summary

## Executive Summary
The **AnyCap Project** is a comprehensive framework that addresses the need for *controllable omni-modal captioning*, enabling precise *multimodal alignment* and *instruction following*. The project introduces a **unified framework**, consisting of the **AnyCapModel (ACM)**, **AnyCapDataset (ACD)**, and **AnyCapEval** benchmark, which collectively provide a *lightweight plug-and-play* solution for enhancing the *controllability* of existing *foundation models*. By incorporating *user instructions* and *modality features*, ACM generates improved captions without requiring *retraining* of the base model.

## Key Contributions and Findings
* **Unified Framework**: The AnyCap Project provides a comprehensive solution for *controllable omni-modal captioning*, including a *model*, *dataset*, and *evaluation benchmark*.
* **AnyCapModel (ACM)**: ACM is a *lightweight plug-and-play* framework that enhances the *controllability* of existing *foundation models* by incorporating *user instructions* and *modality features*.
* **AnyCapDataset (ACD)**: ACD is a large-scale *dataset* covering *three modalities*, *28 user-instruction types*, and *300k high-quality data entries*, addressing the issue of *data scarcity* in *controllable multimodal captioning*.
* **AnyCapEval Benchmark**: AnyCapEval is a new *benchmark* that provides more *reliable evaluation metrics* for *controllable captioning* by *decoupling content accuracy* and *stylistic fidelity*.
* **Performance Gains**: ACM achieves substantial *performance gains* on widely used *benchmarks*, including *MIA-Bench* and *VidCapBench*, with notable improvements in *content scores* and *style scores*.

## Methodology Overview
The methodology involves the development of the **AnyCapModel (ACM)**, which *reuses original captions* from base models and incorporates *user instructions* and *modality features* using *specific techniques* such as *modality feature extraction* and *instruction encoding*. The **AnyCapDataset (ACD)** is constructed by *collecting and annotating* a large-scale dataset with *diverse modalities* and *user instructions*. The **AnyCapEval** benchmark is designed to *evaluate controllable captioning models* using *reliable metrics* that *decouple content accuracy* and *stylistic fidelity*.

## Results and Performance
The key results show that ACM achieves significant **performance gains** on various *benchmarks*, with notable improvements in **content scores** (up to *45%*) and **style scores** (up to *12%*). The results also demonstrate that ACM is effective in *enhancing the controllability* of existing *foundation models*, including *GPT-4o* and other widely used models. The **AnyCapEval** benchmark provides a more *reliable evaluation* of controllable captioning models, allowing for *fair comparisons* between different models.

## Limitations and Future Work
The limitations of the study include the potential *bias* in the **AnyCapDataset (ACD)** and the need for further *evaluation* of the **AnyCapModel (ACM)** on more *diverse datasets*. Future work may involve *expanding the dataset* to include more *modalities* and *user instructions*, as well as *improving the efficiency* of the **AnyCapModel (ACM)**.

## Practical Applications
The **AnyCap Project** has significant *practical implications* for various applications, including *image captioning*, *video captioning*, and *multimodal dialogue systems*. The project's *unified framework* and *reliable evaluation benchmark* can facilitate the development of more *accurate* and *controllable* captioning models, enabling more *effective human-computer interaction* and *improved accessibility* for *visually impaired individuals*.
