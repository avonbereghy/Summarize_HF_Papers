**Paper ID:** 2507.14958

**URL:** https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.14958

## Summary

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces **Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR)**, a novel approach to optimize the reasoning efficiency of *Large Language Models (LLMs)*. By dynamically allocating thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps, MUR reduces computation by over 50% on average while improving accuracy. This is achieved through the concept of *momentum* in physics, where **stepwise uncertainty** is tracked and aggregated over time. The authors also introduce **gamma-control**, a simple mechanism that tunes the reasoning budget via a single *hyperparameter*. This approach has significant implications for *reasoning-intensive tasks*, where **Test-Time Scaling (TTS)** methods often lead to *overthinking* and wasted computations.

## Key Contributions and Findings
* **MUR Framework**: The authors propose a novel framework that dynamically allocates thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps, reducing computation and improving accuracy. This is achieved through *stepwise uncertainty* tracking and aggregation over time.
* **Gamma-Control Mechanism**: The introduction of **gamma-control** allows for flexible inference-time control, tuning the reasoning budget via a single *hyperparameter*. This mechanism enables *efficient* and *adaptive* guidance of LLM test-time scaling.
* **Theoretical Foundations**: The authors provide *in-depth theoretical proof* to support the superiority of MUR in terms of *stability* and *biases*. This provides a solid foundation for the approach and its applications.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation**: MUR is evaluated against various TTS methods across four challenging benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing computation and improving accuracy. This evaluation highlights the potential of MUR for *real-world applications*.
* **Scalability**: The approach is shown to be scalable, with evaluations using different sizes of recent *Qwen3 models* (1.7B, 4B, and 8B). This demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of MUR.

## Methodology Overview
The methodology involves **Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR)**, which consists of two major components: **stepwise uncertainty tracking** and **gamma-control**. The approach uses *specific techniques* such as *uncertainty aggregation* and *hyperparameter tuning* to dynamically allocate thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps. The **MUR framework** is designed to be flexible and adaptive, allowing for *efficient* and *effective* guidance of LLM test-time scaling.

## Results and Performance
The results demonstrate that MUR reduces computation by over **50%** on average while improving **accuracy** by *0.62-3.37%*. This is compared to various TTS methods across four challenging benchmarks, including *MATH-500*, *AIME24*, *AIME25*, and *GPQA-diamond*. The evaluation highlights the effectiveness of MUR in reducing computation and improving accuracy, making it a promising approach for *reasoning-intensive tasks*.

## Limitations and Future Work
The paper does not explicitly mention limitations, but potential future directions include:
* Exploring the application of MUR to other *language models* and *reasoning tasks*
* Investigating the use of *alternative uncertainty measures* and *hyperparameter tuning methods*
* Evaluating the effectiveness of MUR in *real-world scenarios* and *practical applications*

## Practical Applications
The proposed approach has significant implications for *real-world applications*, including:
* **Efficient language understanding**: MUR can be used to optimize the reasoning efficiency of LLMs, reducing computation and improving accuracy in *language understanding tasks*.
* **Automated reasoning**: The approach can be applied to *automated reasoning tasks*, such as *mathematical reasoning* and *logical reasoning*, to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
* **Decision-making systems**: MUR can be used to optimize the decision-making process in *complex systems*, reducing computation and improving accuracy in *high-stakes applications*.
