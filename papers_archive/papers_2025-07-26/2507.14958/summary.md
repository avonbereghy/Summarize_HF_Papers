**Paper ID:** 2507.14958

**URL:** https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.14958

## Summary

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces **Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR)**, a novel approach to optimize the reasoning efficiency of *Large Language Models (LLMs)*. By dynamically allocating thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps, MUR reduces computation by over 50% on average while improving accuracy. This is achieved through the use of *gamma-control*, a simple mechanism that tunes the reasoning budget via a single hyperparameter. The authors provide an in-depth theoretical proof to support the superiority of MUR in terms of *stability* and *biases*, making it a promising solution for *reasoning-intensive tasks*.

## Key Contributions and Findings
* **Improved Reasoning Efficiency**: MUR dynamically allocates thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps by tracking and aggregating *stepwise uncertainty* over time, reducing computation by over 50% on average.
* **Theoretical Foundations**: The authors provide a comprehensive theoretical proof to support the superiority of MUR in terms of *stability* and *biases*, ensuring reliable performance in various scenarios.
* **Flexible Inference-Time Control**: The introduction of *gamma-control* allows for flexible inference-time control, enabling easy tuning of the reasoning budget via a single hyperparameter.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation**: MUR is evaluated against various *Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods* across four challenging benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving accuracy by 0.62-3.37%.
* **Scalability**: MUR is shown to be effective across different sizes of recent *Qwen3 models*, including 1.7B, 4B, and 8B parameters.

## Methodology Overview
The methodology involves the use of **Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR)**, which consists of two major components: **uncertainty tracking** and **gamma-control**. The *uncertainty tracking* module dynamically allocates thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps by aggregating *stepwise uncertainty* over time. The *gamma-control* mechanism allows for flexible inference-time control, enabling easy tuning of the reasoning budget via a single hyperparameter.

## Results and Performance
The results demonstrate that MUR reduces computation by over **50%** on average while improving **accuracy** by 0.62-3.37%. The evaluation is performed across four challenging benchmarks, including *MATH-500*, *AIME24*, *AIME25*, and *GPQA-diamond*, using different sizes of recent *Qwen3 models*. The comparison with various *TTS methods* shows that MUR achieves *state-of-the-art* performance in terms of **computation efficiency** and **accuracy**.

## Limitations and Future Work
The paper does not mention specific limitations of the proposed approach. However, potential future directions include:
* Exploring the application of MUR to other *natural language processing tasks*
* Investigating the use of *alternative uncertainty estimation methods*
* Evaluating the performance of MUR on larger and more diverse datasets

## Practical Applications
The proposed **Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR)** approach has potential real-world applications in various areas, including:
* *Question answering systems*, where efficient reasoning is crucial for providing accurate answers
* *Natural language processing tasks*, such as text classification and sentiment analysis, where MUR can improve computation efficiency and accuracy
* *Conversational AI systems*, where MUR can enable more efficient and effective dialogue management
