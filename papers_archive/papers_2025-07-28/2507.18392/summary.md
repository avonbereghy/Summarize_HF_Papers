**Paper ID:** 2507.18392

**URL:** https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.18392

## Summary

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces **CLEAR**, an interactive, open-source package for *Large Language Model (LLM)*-based error analysis, which aims to bridge the gap between top-level scores and specific, actionable reasons behind a model's performance. By utilizing *LLMs as judges*, **CLEAR** generates per-instance textual feedback, creates system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each identified issue. This package provides users with an interactive dashboard for comprehensive error analysis, allowing for *aggregate visualizations*, *interactive filters*, and drilling down to individual instances. The authors demonstrate **CLEAR** analysis for *RAG and Math benchmarks*, showcasing its utility through a user case study, and highlighting the importance of understanding *why* a model performs better, rather than just *which* model is better.

## Key Contributions and Findings
* **Introduction of CLEAR**: The authors introduce **CLEAR**, an open-source package for *LLM*-based error analysis, which provides a comprehensive framework for understanding model performance.
* **Error Analysis Methodology**: **CLEAR** uses a novel approach to generate per-instance textual feedback, creating system-level error issues, and quantifying the prevalence of each identified issue, allowing for *in-depth analysis* of model behavior.
* **Interactive Dashboard**: The package includes an interactive dashboard that enables users to apply *interactive filters*, visualize *aggregate results*, and drill down to individual instances, making it easier to identify and address specific error patterns.
* **Case Study and Evaluation**: The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of **CLEAR** through a user case study and evaluation on *RAG and Math benchmarks*, showcasing its potential to improve model performance and *benchmarking*.
* **Open-Source Availability**: **CLEAR** is made available as an open-source package, allowing researchers and developers to easily integrate and utilize the tool for their own *LLM*-based error analysis.

## Methodology Overview
The **CLEAR** methodology consists of **three major components**: **textual feedback generation**, **system-level error issue creation**, and **quantification of error prevalence**. The authors use *natural language processing techniques* to generate per-instance textual feedback, which is then used to create system-level error issues. The package also employs *data visualization techniques* to provide an interactive dashboard for comprehensive error analysis.

## Results and Performance
The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of **CLEAR** through a case study and evaluation on *RAG and Math benchmarks*, showcasing its ability to identify and quantify specific error patterns. The results highlight the importance of understanding *why* a model performs better, rather than just *which* model is better, with **CLEAR** providing a **significant improvement** in error analysis and model performance. The package allows for *detailed comparisons* between different models and *benchmarking* results, enabling researchers to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of their models.

## Limitations and Future Work
The authors mention that **CLEAR** is currently limited to *LLM*-based error analysis and may not be directly applicable to other types of models. Potential future directions include **expanding the package to support other model types**, **improving the scalability and efficiency** of the package, and **integrating CLEAR with other evaluation frameworks**.

## Practical Applications
The **CLEAR** package has significant practical applications in *natural language processing*, *machine learning*, and *artificial intelligence*. It can be used to improve model performance, identify and address specific error patterns, and provide a more comprehensive understanding of model behavior. The package can also be used in *real-world applications*, such as *chatbots*, *language translation*, and *text summarization*, to improve the accuracy and reliability of *LLM*-based systems. Additionally, **CLEAR** can be used in *educational settings* to help students understand the strengths and weaknesses of different models and improve their overall performance.
