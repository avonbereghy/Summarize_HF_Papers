**Paper ID:** 2508.03694

**URL:** https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.03694

## Summary

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces **LongVie**, a novel framework for controllable ultra-long video generation, addressing the challenges of *temporal inconsistency* and *visual degradation* in existing methods. By investigating key factors such as **separate noise initialization**, **independent control signal normalization**, and the limitations of *single-modality guidance*, the authors propose an end-to-end autoregressive framework that ensures **temporal consistency** and **visual quality**. The framework employs a **unified noise initialization strategy**, **global control signal normalization**, and a *multi-modal control framework* to achieve state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and quality.

## Key Contributions and Findings
* **Methodology Innovation**: The authors propose a novel framework, **LongVie**, which introduces a *unified noise initialization strategy* to maintain consistent generation across clips, and *global control signal normalization* to enforce alignment in the control space throughout the entire video.
* **Multi-Modal Control**: LongVie employs a *multi-modal control framework* that integrates both *dense* (e.g., depth maps) and *sparse* (e.g., keypoints) control signals to mitigate *visual degradation*.
* **Degradation-Aware Training**: The framework uses a *degradation-aware training strategy* that adaptively balances modality contributions over time to preserve *visual quality*.
* **Benchmark Introduction**: The authors introduce **LongVGenBench**, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100 high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments, each lasting over one minute.
* **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Extensive experiments show that **LongVie** achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and quality, outperforming existing methods in terms of *temporal consistency* and *visual quality*.

## Methodology Overview
The **LongVie** framework consists of **two core designs**: a **unified noise initialization strategy** and **global control signal normalization**, which ensure **temporal consistency**. The framework also employs a **multi-modal control framework** that integrates *dense* and *sparse* control signals, complemented by a *degradation-aware training strategy* that adaptively balances modality contributions over time. The methodology uses **autoregressive modeling** and *iterative refinement* to generate high-quality videos.

## Results and Performance
The experiments demonstrate that **LongVie** achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of **long-range controllability**, **temporal consistency**, and **visual quality**, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin. The results show that **LongVie** can generate high-quality videos with *consistent temporal structure* and *preserved visual quality*, even for videos lasting over one minute. The evaluation metrics include **peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)**, **structural similarity index (SSIM)**, and *visual information fidelity (VIF)*, which demonstrate the superiority of **LongVie**.

## Limitations and Future Work
The paper mentions that **LongVie** may still suffer from *mode collapse* and *training instability*, which can be addressed in future work. Potential future directions include exploring *new control signals*, *improving training strategies*, and *applying LongVie to real-world applications*.

## Practical Applications
The **LongVie** framework has significant implications for various real-world applications, such as *video production*, *special effects*, and *virtual reality*. The ability to generate high-quality, controllable ultra-long videos can revolutionize the *entertainment industry*, *advertising*, and *education*. Additionally, **LongVie** can be used for *data augmentation*, *video summarization*, and *video analysis*, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of computer vision and video processing.
