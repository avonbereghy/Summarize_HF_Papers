**Paper ID:** 2508.04026

**URL:** https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.04026

## Summary

## Executive Summary
The paper introduces **VeriGUI**, a novel *verifiable* long-chain GUI dataset designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of **generalist GUI agents** operating in realistic computer environments. The dataset emphasizes two critical dimensions: (1) **long-chain complexity**, with tasks decomposed into a sequence of interdependent subtasks spanning hundreds of steps, and (2) **subtask-level verifiability**, which enables *diverse exploration strategies* within each subtask. The goal of **VeriGUI** is to address the limitations of existing efforts, which mainly focus on *short-term interactions* and rely on *outcome-only verification*, by providing a more comprehensive and *scalable* approach to GUI-based computer tasks.

## Key Contributions and Findings
* **Dataset Design**: The paper presents a novel dataset design that emphasizes **long-chain complexity** and **subtask-level verifiability**, allowing for more *realistic* and *challenging* GUI-based computer tasks.
* **Task Decomposition**: The dataset consists of GUI task trajectories that are decomposed into a sequence of interdependent subtasks, enabling *diverse exploration strategies* and *more efficient* task execution.
* **Evaluation Framework**: The paper provides an evaluation framework for **GUI agents** using **VeriGUI**, which reveals significant *performance gaps* in handling **long-horizon tasks** and highlights the need for more *robust planning* and *decision-making capabilities*.
* **Foundation Models**: The paper explores the use of different **foundation models** in **GUI agents**, demonstrating the importance of *careful model selection* and *fine-tuning* for optimal performance.
* **Human-Computer Interaction**: The paper has implications for **human-computer interaction**, as **VeriGUI** can be used to develop more *intelligent* and *autonomous* GUI agents that can *revolutionize* the way humans interact with computers.

## Methodology Overview
The methodology consists of **data collection**, **data annotation**, and **evaluation framework** components. The **data collection** process involves gathering GUI task trajectories across both **desktop** and **web** environments, while the **data annotation** process involves annotating the trajectories with *human expert* labels. The **evaluation framework** uses *various agents* with different **foundation models** to evaluate the performance of **GUI agents** on **VeriGUI**.

## Results and Performance
The results show significant **performance gaps** in handling **long-horizon tasks**, with **metrics** such as *success rate* and *efficiency* highlighting the need for more *robust planning* and *decision-making capabilities*. The comparison between different **foundation models** reveals that *careful model selection* and *fine-tuning* are crucial for optimal performance, with some models performing better than others in certain *scenarios*.

## Limitations and Future Work
The limitations of the paper include the need for more *diverse* and *representative* datasets, as well as the development of more *advanced* and *efficient* evaluation frameworks. Potential future directions include exploring the use of **VeriGUI** in other *domains*, such as *robotics* and *natural language processing*, and developing more *intelligent* and *autonomous* GUI agents that can *learn* and *adapt* to new tasks and environments.

## Practical Applications
The practical applications of **VeriGUI** include developing more *intelligent* and *autonomous* GUI agents that can *revolutionize* the way humans interact with computers. Potential real-world applications include *automating* repetitive and *time-consuming* tasks, *improving* user experience and *productivity*, and *enhancing* accessibility for *people with disabilities*. The implications of **VeriGUI** are far-reaching, with potential applications in *various industries*, such as *healthcare*, *finance*, and *education*.
